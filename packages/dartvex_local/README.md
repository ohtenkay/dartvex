## The Dartvex ecosystem

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [`dartvex`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartvex) | Core client — WebSocket sync, subscriptions, auth |
| [`dartvex_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartvex_flutter) | Flutter widgets — Provider, Query, Mutation |
| [`dartvex_codegen`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartvex_codegen) | CLI code generator — type-safe Dart bindings from schema |
| **[`dartvex_local`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartvex_local)** | Offline support — SQLite cache, mutation queue |
| [`dartvex_auth_better`](https://pub.dev/packages/dartvex_auth_better) | Better Auth adapter |

## What it does

- **Query cache** — remote query results are persisted in SQLite and served
  as fallback when the remote is unreachable or slow.
- **Offline mutation queue** — mutations issued while offline are queued and
  replayed in order when connectivity resumes.
- **At-least-once replay** — queued mutations can be retried after ambiguous
  network failures, so server mutations should be idempotent when they trigger
  external side effects.
- **Optimistic updates** — app-defined `LocalMutationHandler` patches are
  applied to the cache immediately, before the mutation reaches the server.
- **Deterministic network mode** — `setNetworkMode(offline)` forces the
  client offline regardless of actual connectivity.

## What it does NOT do

- No CRDTs or conflict-free merge engine. Conflicts are surfaced via the
  `onConflict` callback — the app decides what to do.
- No automatic cache eviction by default. Results stay until `clearCache()`
  unless you configure `LocalClientConfig.queryCachePolicy`, which can expire
  stale entries and cap the SQLite cache to a maximum entry count.
- No bundled web storage. The included `SqliteLocalStore` requires native
  `dart:io` targets; on web, supply your own `CacheStorage`/`QueueStorage`.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| iOS / Android | Supported with native SQLite |
| macOS / Linux / Windows | Supported with native SQLite |
| Web | Bundled `SqliteLocalStore` unavailable — supply a custom store |

> **Requirements:** `dartvex_local` requires Dart **≥ 3.10** — its `sqlite3`
> dependency sets that floor. The other Dartvex packages have their own
> package-specific Dart and Flutter floors; check each package's `pubspec.yaml`
> or README before pinning a shared SDK floor.
>
> The bundled `SqliteLocalStore` is native-only (`dart:io`). To run
> `ConvexLocalClient` on the web, implement the `CacheStorage` and
> `QueueStorage` interfaces yourself (for example over IndexedDB) and pass them
> in `LocalClientConfig`. `CacheStorage.deleteCacheEntry` must physically remove
> a single entry so optimistic rollback and cache expiry stay correct.
> `QueueStorage` must also persist failed locally-generated IDs so replay can
> keep dependent mutations from being sent with stale IDs after a restart.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  dartvex: ^0.2.0
  dartvex_local: ^0.2.0
```

## Quick Start

```dart
import 'package:dartvex_local/dartvex_local.dart';

final store = await SqliteLocalStore.open('/tmp/dartvex_demo.sqlite');

final localClient = await ConvexLocalClient.open(
  client: remoteConvexClient,
  config: LocalClientConfig(
    cacheStorage: store,
    queueStorage: store,
    mutationHandlers: <LocalMutationHandler>[],
  ),
);
```

## Mutation Handlers

```dart
class SendMessageHandler extends LocalMutationHandler {
  @override
  String get mutationName => 'messages:send';

  @override
  List<LocalMutationPatch> buildPatches(
    Map<String, dynamic> args,
    LocalMutationContext context,
  ) {
    return [
      LocalMutationPatch(
        target: const LocalQueryDescriptor('messages:list'),
        apply: (currentValue) {
          final list = currentValue is List
              ? List<dynamic>.from(currentValue)
              : <dynamic>[];
          list.add({'_id': context.operationId, ...args});
          return list;
        },
      ),
    ];
  }
}
```

Handlers run for both connected direct sends and queued/offline mutations. A
handled direct mutation is persisted and patched before the remote call, so
incoming server snapshots can be rebased while it is pending. Handlers may also
provide the value returned while queued, such as a local ID for a create:

```dart
@override
dynamic optimisticValue(
  Map<String, dynamic> args,
  LocalMutationContext context,
) => context.operationId;
```

Generated APIs accept `ConvexFunctionCaller`. Wrap the local client and supply
the remote caller used for paginated queries:

```dart
final caller = ConvexLocalFunctionCaller(
  localClient: localClient,
  remoteCaller: remoteConvexClient,
  nullableQueuedMutations: {'messages:markRead'},
);
final api = Api(caller);
```

When a mutation is queued, the adapter requires a non-null handler-provided
`optimisticValue`. List mutations whose generated return type accepts `null` in
`nullableQueuedMutations`; they continue to return `null` while queued. This
turns a missing optimistic value for a non-null generated return type into an
immediate, descriptive `StateError` instead of a later cast failure.

## API Overview

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ConvexLocalClient` | Offline-aware client with cache and queue |
| `ConvexLocalFunctionCaller` | Generated API adapter for the local client |
| `QueryCache` | Persistent query cache with expiry/pruning policy |
| `MutationQueue` | Pending mutation queue with retry |
| `SqliteLocalStore` | SQLite-backed local storage |
| `PendingMutation` | Queued mutation with status tracking |

## Error Behavior

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Remote query fails (retryable) | Falls back to cache if available |
| Query while offline, no cache | Throws `StateError` |
| Mutation while offline | Queued as `LocalMutationQueued` |
| Handled mutation queued | Adapter returns the handler's optimistic value |
| Mutation replay fails (non-retryable) | Dropped, `onConflict` called |
| Action while offline | Throws `ConvexException` |
